# First Image: ProfitvsDisct

The first image shows the profit of a retail store against the discount provided each year. A reference line is added to represent the avergae value of each pane.
# Observations : 
* The profit from furniture in the year 2012 reduced from 2011, probably because discounts were increased but this might be just coincidental since the rest of the graph does not show such indication. This might just be an anomaly.
* Office Supplies is the top category to generate most profit and provide the most discount.
* Furniture provides the second most discount, yet generate the least profit, maybe because furniture is more lasting than office supplies and technology (which is ever changing).

# Second Image : ProfitvsDisctRegions

The second image shows the profit of a retail store against the discount provided in each region over all each year. A reference line is added here as well to show the average value.

# Observations :
* Central Region generates the most profit and provides the most discount.
* In both graphs, Central region is the only region that crosses the reference line.
* South region might be so drastically different than other regions because there were only three countries involved in this dataset, in contrast with 6 countries in the Central and North region.
